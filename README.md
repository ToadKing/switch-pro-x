**WARNING:** This is currently a work in progress. Don't expect a simple package for installing/running anytime soon.

Requires:
* Visual Studio 2017.
* [Windows SDK 10](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk). Built against version 10.0.15063.
* [WDK 10](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/windows-driver-kit). Needed for some headers and libraries.
* [ViGEm](https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEm). You will need both the bus driver from the 1.8.1.0 release (1.10.0.0 is buggy) and the HidGuardian Driver + HidCerberus.Srv. Currently requires devcon.exe from the Windows SDK to install.
